# Türk Ticaret Net - E-commerce API

## Installation

To get started with the TurkTicaretNet - Ecommerce API Project, follow these steps to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Docker**: Used to create a consistent development environment.
- **Docker Compose**: To manage multi-container Docker applications.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bilalbaraz/turkticaretnet.git
    cd turkticaretnet
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary PHP dependencies using Composer:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Copy the example environment file and update it with your local settings:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Generate Application Key**: Generate the Laravel application key, which is used for encryption:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

4. **Generate Application Key**: Generate the JWT secret key, which is used for encryption:

    ```bash
    php artisan jwt:secret
    ```


5. **Start Docker Containers**: Use Laravel Sail to start the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```

6. **Run Database Migrations with Seeders**: Set up your database by running the migrations:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
    ```

This will create the necessary tables and seed the database with demo data.

7. **Access the Application**:
Once everything is set up, you can access the application in your browser at:

    ```bash
    http://localhost
    ```

Your "TurkTicaretNet - Ecommerce API" development environment should now be up and running. You can begin developing and testing the API according to your project's requirements.

**Stop Docker Containers**: Use Laravel Sail to stop the Docker containers:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail down
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the Türk Ticaret Net - Ecommerce API Project, this section will help you diagnose and resolve common problems.

### 1. Docker Containers Not Starting

**Issue**: Docker containers fail to start or keep restarting.

**Solution**:
- Ensure Docker is properly installed and running on your machine.
- Check if the ports required by the containers (e.g., MySQL on port 3306) are already in use by another application. You may need to stop the other application or configure Docker to use different ports.
- Review the Docker logs for more detailed error messages:

    ```bash
    docker logs <container_name>
    ```
